<h3 class="mb-3 text-black text-uppercase">What To Expect Next</h3>
<p class="mb-3 text-dark lh-base font-weight-normal"> 

Your initial call or contact may not be with a licensed attorney and does not constitute legal advice or create an attorney-client relationship. A participating law firm or their agent may evaluate your case and by that process they do not thereby establish an attorney-client relationship. Transmission of information to Our law firm clients about potential clients responding to Any Communication from Us is not intended to create and does not constitute an attorney-client relationship. Viewing or hearing Any Communication from Us, requesting additional information, or transmitting information back and forth, should never be considered the formation of an attorney-client relationship. The law firm or their representative that responds to your inquiry will have no obligation to take any action to protect your interests unless he or she agrees to do so in writing pursuant to their terms and conditions. We do not guarantee a response to your inquires, although in most cases you should be contacted by a lawyer or their representative within three to five business days if your inquiry has not already been answered. Results are not guaranteed.
</p>

<h3 class="mb-3 text-black text-uppercase">Client-Attorney Relationships and Legal or Case Related Considerations </h3>
<p class="mb-3 text-dark lh-base font-weight-normal"> 

 
A Client-Attorney relationship will only be created by a written agreement between a law firm and a client. You understand and agree that any information you initially provide to Us or a law firm evaluating your case, is done so voluntarily and will not be considered nor treated as confidential information until such law firm has been retained by you in writing. Since We are not a law firm, such information will never be deemed or agreed to be confidential.

</p>

<h3 class="mb-3 text-black text-uppercase">Your Case</h3>

The material and data from Any Communication from us is general in nature and may not apply to your specific circumstances. Every case comes with its own set of unique circumstances and facts. A participating law firm may accept or reject a case based at their sole discretion. Rejection of your case is not the expression of a legal opinion about your case, instead you are encouraged to discuss the matter with any other law firm or attorney of your choice. If there are multiple participating firms, matching of an initial inquiry to a specific law firm is done by an internal random process. Some cases may be transferred to other attorneys, discuss with your attorney. The law firm or their representative that responds to your inquiry will have no obligation to take any action to protect your interests unless he or she agrees to do so in writing pursuant to their terms and conditions. We do not guarantee a response to your inquires, although in most cases you should be contacted by a lawyer or their representative within three to five business days if your inquiry has not already been answered. Results are not guaranteed.
